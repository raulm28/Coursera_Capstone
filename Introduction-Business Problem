Introduction

For any business that is seeking to grow and expand their operations, there's a tried and true mantra: "Location, Location, Location".
Where and when to expand is an essential knowledge asset in the marketplace, which can in turn benefit customers with competition and innovation while reducing cost.
This, however, is a challenge when the markets differ from one another, depending on the population and the market saturation of a product.

Business Problem

The example to be used will be of an Acupuncture business looking to open a chain of offices around the country in different states and markets.
Key metric is the number of offices per zip code per city, which will be used to determine the best cities to open new offices for a better competition.
This will drive stakeholder's decisions on the future steps for further expansion.
